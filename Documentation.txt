To prevent downstream inconsistencies:
Domain knowledge has it that asides the NOK and SEK, the EUR represents
a standard base currency accross the Nordics where our client is from.
So, first I replicated the missing currency values in a separate column called currency_imputed for
data lineage tracking, then replaced the missing currencies with the EUR on the currency column. 
I normalized all currency codes to uppercase ISO format as well, then, mapped eur into EUR.
