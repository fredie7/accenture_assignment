Transactions without a customer_id were excluded as they cannot support customer-level 
analytics or even AI use cases.

Missing categories were assigned to an "unknown" bucket to preserve transaction completeness.

For the mamoth 2000 duplicate transaction_id's in the transaction data, I 
investigated the timestamp for late-arriving data and pipeline retries to retain the
the most recent version.
I deleted the missing values since none of those factors seemed attribute to the duplicate data.

To prevent downstream inconsistencies:
Domain knowledge has it that asides the NOK and SEK, the EUR represents
a standard base currency accross the Nordics where our client is from.
So, first I replicated the missing currency values in a separate column called currency_imputed for
financial lineage tracking, then replaced the missing currencies with the EUR on the currency column. 
I normalized all currency codes to uppercase ISO format as well, then, mapped eur into EUR.
